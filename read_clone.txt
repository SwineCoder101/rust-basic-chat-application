üìò Technical Improvement Specification Document
1. Project Overview
Project Name: Web3 Job Marketplace


Purpose: A decentralized freelance job marketplace built on Solana, enabling trustless job posting, bidding, and escrow-based payments.


Goal of This Document: Identify improvement areas and provide detailed technical guidance for upgrading, optimizing, and expanding the current platform.



2. Current Tech Stack Summary
Layer
Technology
Notes
Frontend
React.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS
Wallet connection, job listings, bidding UI
Backend
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
API for jobs, users, transactions
Blockchain
Solana + Rust Smart Contracts
Manages escrow, job creation, and payment
Web3
Solana Web3.js, Wallet Adapters
Wallet connection and blockchain calls


3. Current Architecture
Client: Communicates with backend and Solana via Web3.js.


Server: Handles REST APIs, JWT authentication, and MongoDB.


Smart Contract (Solana Program): Controls job lifecycle (create ‚Üí escrow ‚Üí release).


Wallets: Phantom, Solflare (integrated via Solana wallet adapter).

4. Known Issues / Improvement Areas
Area
Issue
Suggested Improvement
Smart Contract
Limited functionality (basic job contract)
Add milestone payments, job cancellation, and arbitration logic
Backend
No WebSocket updates
Implement real-time job/transaction status with Socket.io
Frontend
UI not optimized for mobile
Apply responsive design improvements using Tailwind
Authentication
Basic JWT + wallet
Add wallet signature-based authentication
Security
No input validation for blockchain data
Add input sanitization and signature verification
Performance
Slow load on large job lists
Implement pagination and caching
Codebase
No modular folder structure
Refactor to follow feature-based architecture


5. Proposed Enhancements
üß© Smart Contract (Rust / Solana)
Refactor program to support:


Job escrow with milestone payments


Job cancellation and dispute resolution


Multi-signature wallet approvals


Add program-level logging and better error handling


Write unit tests using Solana Program Test framework


‚öôÔ∏è Backend (Node.js / Express)
Add real-time notifications (Socket.io) for job status updates


Improve API error handling and logging


Add signature-based authentication for wallet verification


Integrate transaction monitoring service (via Solana RPC/Webhook)


üíª Frontend (React + TypeScript)
Improve dashboard design and responsiveness


Add wallet-based login flow (Phantom, Solflare)


Implement real-time contract and payment updates


Add filters, sorting, and pagination for job browsing


üîê Security & Infrastructure
Enforce HTTPS and secure headers


Validate all blockchain and API inputs


Migrate to secure deployment (Docker + Nginx)


Add monitoring for smart contract and server errors



6. Testing and QA Plan
Unit testing for smart contracts and APIs


Integration tests for wallet authentication


Frontend E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress


Smart contract test suite using Solana Test Validator



7. Deployment Recommendations
CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI


Versioned smart contract deployment via Anchor


Use Solana Devnet for staging and Mainnet for production


Add rollback plan for failed deployments



8. Future Features (Optional)
DAO-based job verification or arbitration


NFT-based freelancer reputation system


Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, Base)


In-app chat system (Web3 messaging protocol)



9. Deliverables for Developer
Clean, modularized frontend and backend code


Enhanced Solana smart contract with new features


Updated documentation (README + API + deployment guide)


QA-tested staging deployment
